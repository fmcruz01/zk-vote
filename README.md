A simple decentralized application that explores how **zero-knowledge proofs (zk-SNARKs)** can be applied to a real-world use case: **anonymous and verifiable voting**.  

My main goal with this project is to **learn and understand how zero-knowledge proofs work** and how they can be used in practice, while also improving my Solidity and Frontend development skills.
